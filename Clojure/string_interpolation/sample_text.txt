In this example, I've created a new namespace called my-namespace to contain the functions. I've also fixed a small syntax error in the repeat-string function signature (you don't need to use square brackets around the arguments).

I've also sorted the functions alphabetically and made some minor formatting changes to make the code more readable.

Finally, I've added comments to each function and included examples of how to use them at the end of the file.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
